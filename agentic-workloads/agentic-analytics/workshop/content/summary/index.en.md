## What You Built

Congratulations! You've built a self-service analytics system for Timely-Unicorn and learnt on the path to get your agentic system into production. Your tenants can now ask questions in plain English and get instant, accurate, secure answers — no SQL required.

| Step | What You Built | Business Value |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | Test basic agent (exercise) | Understand how LLM selects tools |
| 2 | Agent infrastructure | Gateway + Runtime — production foundation |
| 3 | React chat UI | Business users can interact naturally |
| 4 | Prebaked SQL toolset | Analytics tools backed by database Views |
| 5 | API integration toolset | Connect agent to existing business APIs |
| 6 | Custom SQL toolset | Ad-hoc queries with Glue + Bedrock KB RAG |
| 7 | Multi-Tenant Isolation & User Access | Cedar policies + JWT → PostgreSQL RLS |
| 8 | Guardrails | Off-topic blocked, PII filtered |
| 9 | Observability | Trace agent behavior end-to-end |
| 10 | Evaluation | Measure quality with LLM-as-a-Judge |
| 14 | Semantic Layer (Cube Core) | Structured ad-hoc analytics — flexible yet reliable |

## The Five Security Layers

| Layer | What It Controls | How It Works |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Authentication, Authorization, JWT propagation** | access control | Restrict access to authenticated user and role-based access control with propagated claim |
| **Cedar Policy** | Which tools each role can access | Gateway hides tools from unauthorized users |
| **Row-Level Security** | Which data rows each tenant sees | PostgreSQL filters rows via JWT claims |
| **Bedrock Guardrails** | Content safety and topic boundaries | Blocks off-topic, PII, and schema leakage |
| **SOPs** | Agent behavior and response format | RFC 2119 constraints guide LLM decisions |
| **AgentCore Isolation** | Session isolation | AgentCore Runtime lets you isolate each user session and safely reuse context across multiple invocations in a user session. |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start simple, add capabilities progressively** — local agent → Gateway → Runtime → features
2. **Model-driven approach** — define tools and prompts, let the LLM orchestrate (don't write routing logic)
3. **SOPs make agents reliable** — structured behavior beats ad-hoc prompt engineering
4. **Deterministic security at the infrastructure level** — JWT claim propagation, Cedar policies, and RLS to implement security with role-based access control and multi-tenant isolation
5. **Defense in depth** — multiple security controls to protect against diverse attack vectors
6. **Human-in-the-loop for risky operations** — query plan review and approval before execution, in natural langauge
7. **Observability is not optional** — you can't improve what you can't measure

## Applying This to Your SaaS

The pattern in this workshop maps to a real SaaS challenge:

| Workshop Pattern | Your SaaS Application |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Pool model** (shared DB + agent) | Scale to hundreds of tenants without per-tenant infrastructure |
| **RLS via JWT** | Enforce data isolation at the database level |
| **Cedar policies** | Let tenants configure their own RBAC without custom code per tenant |
| **Guardrails** | Protect your platform from misuse — off-topic, PII |
| **Human-in-the-loop** | Let power users run custom queries while maintaining control |
| **Observability** | Debug tenant-reported issues with full trace visibility |

## Clean Up

If running in Workshop Studio, all resources — including the AWS account itself — are automatically cleaned up when the event ends. No action needed.

For manual cleanup (own account), delete resources in this order:

1. **AgentCore resources** (created by deploy scripts, not in CFN):
Go to AWS UI console for Bedrock AgentCore. Delete resources deployed by this workshop:
- tools associated with the AgentCore Gateway
- AgentCore Policy
- AgentCore Gateway
- AgentCore Runtime

Go to AWS UI console for Bedrock. Delete deployed Guardrails from this workshop.

2. **CloudFormation stack** (deletes Aurora, Glue, Cognito, EC2, Bedrock KB):
```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name agentic-analytics --region us-east-1
```

::alert[The CloudFormation stack deletion handles Aurora, Glue, Cognito, EC2, and Bedrock KB. AgentCore resources (Gateway, Runtime, Policy Engine) were created outside CFN and may need manual deletion via the AgentCore console if running in your own account.]{type="warning"}

Thank you for completing this workshop! We hope Mythical Unicorns and Mythic Unicorns are happy with their new analytics assistant — and you're ready to onboard more tenants.
