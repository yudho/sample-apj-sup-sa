# =============================================================================
# Preparing Daily's transport for AgentCore's IPv6-only environment
# =============================================================================
#
# AgentCore runs containers in an IPv6-only network. Normal Python code that
# needs to talk to IPv4 services (like TURN servers) works transparently —
# DNS64 synthesizes IPv6 addresses and NAT64 translates the packets — so
# Python never even knows it's talking to an IPv4 server.
#
# Daily's libwebrtc, however, doesn't seem to play nicely with the
# environment's DNS64 + NAT64, so it can't reach the TURN servers it needs
# for audio/video. This workaround essentially implements our own DNS64 + NAT64
# translation for Daily's TURN servers specifically:
#
#   1. We resolve TURN hostnames using Python's DNS (which goes through DNS64
#      and works fine).
#
#   2. For each TURN server, we start a local UDP relay on the container's
#      IPv6 address that forwards packets to the real IPv4 TURN server.
#
#   3. We tell libwebrtc (via set_ice_config) to connect to our local relays
#      instead of the original TURN hostnames. From its perspective, the TURN
#      server is at a reachable IPv6 address — no DNS lookup needed.
#
# On a normal network (e.g. local development), the workaround is skipped.
