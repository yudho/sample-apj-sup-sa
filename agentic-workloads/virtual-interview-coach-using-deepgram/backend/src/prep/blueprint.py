"""Session-prep blueprint assembly (T016) — contracts/session-prep-contract.md.

Runs in the prep window (after POST /sessions, before the turn clock). Steps:
  1. Embed the JD once (Titan) — the ONLY LLM call in selection's vicinity, and it is NOT the
     "selection" step; it never recurs per turn (R7).
  2. Classify the JD's role_family deterministically (keyword map, NO LLM) to drive the domain filter.
  3. retrieval.retrieve_ranked(...) — pure DB + pgvector cosine rank (zero LLM, SC-003).
  4. Derive target_competencies (4-6) + ordered_archetype_ids + opening_archetype_id from the ranked
     plan, persist interview_blueprint, and link it onto voice_session.

Niche-role fallback (FR-222): if no approved DOMAIN archetypes match the JD's role, the plan falls back
to General competencies only and sets voice_session.domain_coverage_reduced = TRUE — honest, not silent.

Everything here is off the response_gap clock by construction (it completes before media start).
