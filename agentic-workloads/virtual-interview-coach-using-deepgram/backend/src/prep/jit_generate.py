"""Just-in-time domain question generation (session-prep) — for roles the vetted bank does NOT cover.

When `assemble_blueprint` finds NO approved domain archetypes for a JD's role at the chosen difficulty
(the General-only fallback would otherwise fire), this module generates a small set of JD-specific
domain questions with Bedrock, persists + embeds them, and returns them so the blueprint can compose
them into THIS session's plan.

CONSTITUTION NOTE (Principle II / FR-2c / SC-003 — read this): the vetted bank guarantees that only
HUMAN-REVIEWED ('approved') questions reach a student. This module deliberately RELAXES that guarantee
for *uncovered roles only*: the generated questions are served to the student in the same session, with
NO human review. This is a product decision to never leave a niche-role student with only generic
questions. The trade-off is explicit and logged; the rows are marked so they are auditable and
distinguishable from human-vetted ones (status='approved' so retrieval serves them, source='generated',
and a 'jit' marker in scoring_guidance for audit).

LATENCY (Principle I — unchanged): this runs ONLY in the prep window (after POST /sessions, before the
turn clock). It performs a Bedrock generation call + a Titan embedding call — both already off the
response_gap clock, exactly like _embed_jd and resume parsing. The live turn loop and the pgvector
SELECT remain LLM-free, so SC-001 is not affected.
